   - Confirm in dialog
   - ‚úÖ Should see success message: "Your account has been deleted successfully."
   - ‚úÖ Automatically signed out

3. **Verify Deletion:**

   - **Firebase Auth**: User should be deleted
   - **Firebase Database**: Check `/deletedUsers/` ‚Üí User archived for 30 days
   - **Your Email**: Should receive "‚úÖ Account Deleted" notification

### Test 2: Admin Review (Subscribed User)

   - Register new account
   - Subscribe to Landlord or Creator
   - Active subscription should exist

2. **Request Deletion:**
   - Go to Profile ‚Üí Click "Delete Account"
   - Confirm in dialog
   - ‚úÖ Should see: "Your deletion request has been submitted for review."

3. **Verify Request:**

     - `deletionStatus: "pending_review"`
   - **Your Email**: Should receive "üîî Action Required" email

4. **Approve Deletion Manually:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://us-central1-chitter-chatter-f762a.cloudfunctions.net/approvePendingDeletion \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"userId": "USER_ID_HERE"}'
   ```

5. **Verify Approval:**
   - User deleted from Database + Auth
   - User archived in `/deletedUsers/`
   - Admin receives "‚úÖ Account Deleted" email
   - User receives deletion confirmation email

---

### Test 3: 30-Day Archive Cleanup

**Automatic (Scheduled):**
- Runs daily at 2:00 AM EST
- Checks all archived users
- Permanently deletes archives older than 30 days

**Manual Trigger (For Testing):**
```bash
# Firebase CLI
firebase functions:shell
# Then type:
cleanupArchivedUsers({})
```

**Or wait for scheduled run and check logs:**
```bash
firebase functions:log --only cleanupArchivedUsers
```

---

## üîß Manual Admin Operations

### 1. Manually Delete User (Bypass Checks)
```bash
curl -X POST https://us-central1-chitter-chatter-f762a.cloudfunctions.net/approvePendingDeletion \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "USER_UID_HERE"}'
```

### 2. Check Pending Deletions
Go to Firebase Database:
```
/users/
  Look for users with:
    - deletionRequested: [timestamp]
    - deletionStatus: "pending_review"
```

### 3. View Archived Users
```
/deletedUsers/
  - Each archived user
  - Includes full user data
  - Shows permanentDeletionDate
```

### 4. Manually Clean Anonymous Users
```bash
curl -X POST https://us-central1-chitter-chatter-f762a.cloudfunctions.net/manualCleanupNow
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### System Admin UID
Currently set to: `SYSTEM_ADMIN`

**To Update:**
Edit these files and change `SYSTEM_ADMIN_UID`:
- `functions/src/deletion/requestAccountDeletion.js` (line 5)
- `functions/src/deletion/approvePendingDeletion.js` (line 5)

**Options:**
1. Create a dedicated system user in Firebase Auth
2. Use your actual admin user UID
3. Keep as `SYSTEM_ADMIN` (symbolic only)

### GDPR Compliance
- ‚úÖ Users can request deletion (self-service)
- ‚úÖ Deleted within 30 days maximum
- ‚úÖ Data removed from all systems
- ‚úÖ Confirmation emails sent
- ‚úÖ Right to be forgotten honored

### Data Retention
- **30-day archive**: Allows mistake recovery
- **Permanent deletion**: After 30 days, completely gone
- **Room messages**: Kept (anonymized) or customize in code

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "User not authenticated" error
**Fix**: User must be logged in. Check Firebase Auth token.

### Issue: Deletion works but no email
**Check:**
1. Email exists in Firebase Auth for that user
2. GMAIL credentials in `.env.chitter-chatter-f762a`
3. Function logs for email sending errors

### Issue: Rooms not transferring
**Check:**
1. `SYSTEM_ADMIN_UID` is set correctly
2. User actually owns rooms (check `ownedRooms` array)
3. Room documents exist in `/rooms/`

### Issue: 30-day cleanup not running
**Check:**
1. Cloud Scheduler is enabled
2. Function logs for scheduled execution
3. Schedule syntax: `0 2 * * *` (2 AM daily)
